# Task
Refactor the project according to the [rules](https://github.com/ArmanSo/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt) to be scaleable and readable for a human being.

# Changes
-   Typed version of items `BackstagePassCategory` `CheeseCategory` `ConjuredCategory` `LegendaryCategory` that all extend from `BaseCategory` that responsible for all common logics across items
-   Write unit test(`100%` coverage) to cover all edge cases to make other people lives easier when another refactor or changes needed
